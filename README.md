# WebSum
To summarize AI, the text summarization model uses artificial intelligence 
algorithms to encapsulate an amount of lengthy outlines into concisely 
summarized texts in clear coherence. It is broadly categorized into two modes 
of 
summarization: extractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive 
methods identify and compile relevant sentences or phrases from the original 
text, maintaining the original structure. In contrast, abstractive summarization 
generates sentences paraphrasing the original sentences, utilizing NLP to 
produce output in accordance with human comprehension. 
Deep learning development in models of transformers or pre-trained ones, like 
BERT and GPT, greatly advanced accuracy and fluency in AI summarizers. 
Such procedures are of great use in news aggregation, review of research, and 
extraction of customer feedback data, thereby saving time in perception. 
Despite these merits, they face challenges pertaining to contextual integrity or 
loyalty, issues of bias, and canonical merit. Continuous improvement 
endeavors are undertaken to make passes for these systems for increased 
efficiency and reliability across multiple domains.
